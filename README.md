# FunwithKmeans
Taking my menial attempt at implmenting and understanding the 'actual' KMeans

Implemented KMeans using Kmeans++ initalization and N_init random initializations technique to choose the best seed value based on inertia

Also added the how to plot the elbow graph with the KMeans class implemented here.
